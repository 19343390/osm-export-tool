The **Export Tool** creates OpenStreetMap exports for GIS programs and mobile devices. It outputs files in various tabular formats based on an input area of interest polygon and a selection of OpenStreetMap tags. It is synchronized minutely with the main OSM database, so exports can be created to accompany real-time humanitarian mapping efforts.

The latest version of the Export Tool is available at http://exports-prod.hotosm.org . All users are recommended to use this version.

The previous (version 2) iteration of the Export Tool is available at http://export.hotosm.org . This version is slower and less featureful than the newest version.

## Project Structure

This is a guide to the source code - useful if you'd like to contribute to the Export Tool, deploy the project on your own server, or re-use parts of the project.

`utils/`  contains Python classes responsible for downloading and transforming OSM data into each file format based on a GEOS geometry and a `FeatureSelection` object. Many of these are wrappers for GDAL/OGR commands. This module can be used independently of the web application for creating exports from the command line.

`feature_selection/` contains a parser for YAML feature selections that define how OSM data is mapped to tabular formats. More documentation on the YAML format is available at http://exports-prod.hotosm.org/v3/help/yaml .

`api/` is a Django web application that manages creating, viewing and searching exports, storing feature selections, scheduling jobs, and user accounts via openstreetmap.org OAuth.

`ui/` is a React + ES6 frontend that communicates with the Django API. It handles localization of the user interface, the OpenLayers-based map UI, and the Tag Tree feature selection wizard. (For historical reasons, it also includes some Django views to facilitate logging in with OSM credentials.)

## Development Prerequisites

The Export Tool has several dependencies. As an alternative, use Docker to manage the project's environment, in which case you will need a Docker runtime.

* Python 2.7, `virtualenv`, `pip`
* PostgreSQL 9+ and PostGIS
* GDAL/OGR
* RabbitMQ, a message queue
* Node.js and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Overpass API

The Export Tool queries an instance of the Overpass API for source data. Overpass:

* can efficiently perform spatial queries over large quantities of OSM data, including members of ways and relations.
* has built in facilities to ingest minutely diffs from OpenStreetMap.org.
* can create lossless PBF-format exports, which are necessary for some file formats such as OSMand and Garmin .IMG mobile device maps.

Instructions on installing Overpass are available at https://github.com/drolbr/Overpass-API . Alternatively, Overpass can be run via Docker - see `ops/docker-overpass-api`.

* The export tool is configured with an Overpass URL via the environment variable `OVERPASS_API_URL`. This can be a public Overpass instance, a remote instance you manage yourself, or a local instance on your own computer. Public instances may have strict rate limits, so please use them lightly.
* To set up a local Overpass instance, start with a .pbf file. This can be the full planet .pbf from http://planet.openstreetmap.org or a region, e.g. pbfs available from http://download.geofabrik.de/ .
* Optionally, configure Overpass to update itself minutely.

## Development Step-By-Step Guide

### Clone the HOT Export Tool project from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hotosm/osm-export-tool2.git
cd osm-export-tool2
```

### Install Python dependencies

```bash
virtualenv venv  # creates a new environment in myvirtualenv/
source venv/bin/activate  # activate the virtualenv
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### Database, database schema, and message queue

* PostgreSQL should be running and listening on the default port, 5432, with the shell user having administrative permissions.
* RabbitMQ should be running and listening on the default port, 5672.

Create and populate a PostgreSQL database named `exports`:

```
createdb exports
python manage.py migrate
```

### Compile the front-end application

```bash
cd ui/
yarn install
yarn start  # will watch for changes and re-compile as necessary
```

### Set required environment variables and start the server

```bash
DJANGO_ENV=development DEBUG=True python manage.py runserver

# in a different shell
DJANGO_ENV=development DEBUG=True celery -A core worker
  ```

[`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) is a useful tool for managing environment variables using a `.env` file.

â€‹ You should now be able to navigate to http://localhost:8000 and log in via OSM. With `DJANGO_ENV` set to `development`, emails will not be sent, but the email body will appear in your console from `runserver`. Navigate to this link to verify your account. Creating an export will use the public Overpass API. Successful job creations will write the exports to the filesystem to the `export_downloads` directory, a sibling of the `osm-export-tool2` checkout - since the NGINX file server is not running in development, download links won't be valid.

### Other dependencies

See `core/settings/project.py` for environment variables to configure other optional runtime dependencies.

#### Garmin .IMG

Creating .IMG files requires the `mkgmap` and `splitter` tools.

[http://www.mkgmap.org.uk/download/mkgmap.html](http://www.mkgmap.org.uk/download/mkgmap.html)

[http://www.mkgmap.org.uk/download/splitter.html](http://www.mkgmap.org.uk/download/splitter.html)

#### OSMAnd .OBF

For details and download links to the OSMAnd Map Creator utilities, see [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OsmAndMapCreator](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OsmAndMapCreator)

### List of environment variables

Most of these environment variables have reasonable default settings.

* `EXPORT_STAGING_ROOT`  path to a directory for staging export jobs
* `EXPORT_DOWNLOAD_ROOT`'path to a directory for storing export downloads
* `EXPORT_MEDIA_ROOT` map this url in your webserver to `EXPORT_DOWNLOAD_ROOT` to serve the exported files
* `OSMAND_MAP_CREATOR_DIR` path to directory where OsmAndMapCreator is installed
* `GARMIN_CONFIG`, `GARMIN_MKGMAP` absolute paths to garmin JARs
* `OVERPASS_API_URL` url of Overpass api endpoint
* `BROKER_URL`  Celery broker URL. Defaults to `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/`
* `DATABASE_URL`  Database URL. Defaults to `postgres:///exports`
* `DEBUG`  Whether to enable debug mode. Defaults to `False` (production).
* `DJANGO_ENV`  Django environment. Set to `development` to enable development tools and email logging to console.
* `EMAIL_HOST`  SMTP host. Optional.
* `EMAIL_HOST_USER`  SMTP username. Optional.
* `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` SMTP password. Optional.
* `EMAIL_PORT` SMTP port. Optional.
* `EMAIL_USE_TLS`  Whether to use TLS when sending mail. Optional.
* `HOSTNAME` Publicly-addressable hostname. Defaults to `export.hotosm.org`
* `USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST` - Whether Django is running behind a proxy. Defaults to `False`

### Development with Docker

A `docker-compose.yml` has been provided to facilitate development. To begin, run:

```bash
echo "HOSTNAME=localhost" > .env
docker-compose up
```

This will download and build a set of containers with appropriate versions of various dependencies. `.` will be mounted into `/opt/osm-export-tool2` within the Docker containers, allowing Django and React components to be edited within the host environment.

When initializing the project, you may need to run this twice in order for the database to be initialized.

In a second terminal window, run:

```bash
cd ui/
yarn install
yarn start  # will watch for changes and re-compile as necessary
```

Yarn will watch changes to the React app and rebuild as necessary, writing into appropriate locations within the Docker containers. Live reloading is enabled, so changes should be reflected automatically shortly after they are made.

To use the Docker-managed development instance, navigate to http://localhost/. If you're using `docker-machine` to manage Docker daemons, the hostname may vary, in which case you'll need to change `HOSTNAME` (in `.env`) to reflect it.

## Using the Transifex service

(This section is TBD, as we're currently figuring out workflows for [FormatJS](https://formatjs.io/) JSON strings used by `react-intl`.)

To work with Transifex, you need to create `~/.transifexrc`, and modify its access privileges:

```
chmod 600 ~/.transifexrc
```

Example `.transifexrc` file:


```ini
[https://www.transifex.com]
hostname = https://www.transifex.com
password = my_super_password
token =
username = my_transifex_username
```

### Managing source files

To update source language (English) for Django templates run:

```bash
python manage.py makemessages -l en
```

To update source language for JavaScript files run:

```bash
python manage.py makemessages -d djangojs -l en
```

then, push the new source files to the Transifex service, it will overwrite the current source files

```bash
tx push -s
```

### Pulling latest changes from Transifex

When adding a new language, it's resource file does not exist in the project,
but it's ok as it will be automatically created when pulling new translations from the service. To add a local mapping:

```bash
tx set -r osm-export-tool2.master -l hr locales/hr/LC_MESSAGES/django.po
```

or for JavaScript files:

```bash
tx set -r osm-export-tool2.djangojs -l hr locales/hr/LC_MESSAGES/djangojs.po
```


Once there are some translation updates, pull the latest changes for mapped resources.

For a specific language(s):

```bash
tx pull -l fr,hr
```

For all languages:

```bash
tx pull
```

Finally, compile language files:

```
python manage.py compilemessages
```

### UI Translations

To fetch updated translations for the JavaScript front-end, run:

```bash
cd ui/
yarn run tx:pull
```

To push updated strings to Transifex, run:

```bash
cd ui/

# build the app (to extract new strings)
yarn run pack

yarn run tx:push
```

If / when UI translations pass the 5% complete threshold (defined in `ui/.tx/config` as `minimum_perc`), new JSON files will appear in `ui/app/i18n/locales`. To enable these translations for use, add `react-intl` locale data to `ui/app/app.js` (for date / number formatting) and add options to `ui/app/components/LocaleSelector.js`.
